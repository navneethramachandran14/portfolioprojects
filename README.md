# portfolioprojects
This repository contains data analysis and visualization projects that showcase my skills as a data analyst/scientist. The projects included in this repository demonstrate my ability to analyze and interpret data, derive insights, and present findings using various data visualization techniques. The projects utilize different programming languages and tools such as Python, SQL, Machine learning and Power BI.

Projects:
Heart Disease Prediction -
Heart Disease Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various risk factors and medical parameters. 
The goal of Heart Disease Prediction is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify new, unseen data as either having heart disease or not. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a separate, unseen test dataset to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other performance metrics.

Bulldozers Sales Price Prediction - 
Bulldozers Sales Price Prediction project aims to predict the sale price of used bulldozers based on historical data and relevant features. The goal of Bulldozer Sales Price Prediction is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the sale price of bulldozers in the future. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, typically using a portion of the available data, and its performance is evaluated on a separate, unseen test dataset to assess its accuracy, root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared, and other performance metrics.

Covid Project - 
Covid Project is a data-driven initiative that aims to analyze and understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using various data sources and analytical techniques.
